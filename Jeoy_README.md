# KoalaDAO V 1.0 - Joey
 This is readme file outlines how the bitfwd community will roll out the KoalaDAO experiment as a testbed for innovation and entrepreneurship in web3 native environment. 

## Brief
The KoalaDAO mission is to manage projects and resources as a decentralized ecosystem accelerator community. At the initial stage, the majority of the reputation will be held with the eucalyptus tree committee as described in the governance section. The reputation will be dynamically adjusted using DAOstack's Alchemy platform. The stakeholders of KoalaDAO are diverse and come from different organizations or are independent contributors and others. 

### Web3 ecosystem acceleration
The mission KoalaDAO embody is to bootsrap a peer-to-peer cryptoeconomy, serve the broad web3 ecosystem and specifically nourish the DAOstack ecosystem as a foundation.

### Culture focus
The culture of KoalaDAO:
- **Celebrating entrepreneurship**
 Encourage impactful action bias approach, minimize bureaucracy and self correct as issues arrise. 
 
 - **Grassroots driven** 
  Core value to our ethos are initiatives that promote the success of the true p2p economy movement. 
  
  - **Onboarding and education** 
  A big focus for KoalaDAO is true diversity and inclusion through the onboarding and education using mediums like #Blockathon events, content, and other initiatives in the web3 ecosystem.
