## Governance in the #KoalaDAO

#### The mission

#KoalaDAO #Blockathon is a DAO dedicated to web3 innovation and adoption growth.

#### Traction

Meaningful community outreach (The #Blockathon initiative serves events, onboarding, online competitions), products integrations and partnerships across the ecosystem, we believe the only way to grow is together.

#### vision

A world where people from everywhere are empowered by web3 technologies and leverage it for the communities independent or less dependent on the local nation state monetary systems.


The KoalaDAO #Blockathon will have initial stakeholders from the following groups
1. Community - the joeys üê®üíï
1. Communities Organizers -  KoalaDAO #Blockahton friends who manage communities üê®üëØ‚Äç
1. Gardeners - The inaugal committee that will bootsrap the KoalaDAO #Blockathon operationally üê®üçÉ

- **Reputation Dynamics**

**Earning**
1. Earning reputation can be done in 2 ways (potentially other ways later)
 1. With a reputation request which outlines the reason the proposer believes they should receive REP.
 1. During the retrospect the Eucalyptus Tree facilitator will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation allocation to members based on their work's impact and the merit they showed.

**Slashing**
1. Slashing of reputation can happen in 2 ways (potentially other ways later)
 1. If a KoalaDAO #Blockahton REP holder exhibit distructive actions which other members wish to propose a slashing for they are free and encouraged to do so - self regulation.
 1. During the fortnightly retrospect the gardeners and facilitators will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation slashing to members based on their work's impact, merit and accountability.

#### Gardeners
- Gardeners are the community managers who are making sure everyone is welcome and find the better way. Gardeners will serve in rotational schedule to create a dynamic governance flow.

##### Thesis:

One key experiment is in testing a stronger framework and horizontality rather than purely emergent flat structure:

- We want to give people who are stepping up more responsibility and - **more authority**
- We want to test this with differentiated reputation levels - giving a distribution function to a small group (the **Gardeners üê®üçÉ**) who are paying attention to the context of the whole and where necessary elevate impact/value driven participants.
The Gardeners rewards this with REP and in the process incentivises more action based work to happen.

The Gardeners will act as the crew to oversee the guidance around minimaly required administration processes, culture, and project prioritization. **The Gardeners will share a regular monthly resolution with the
KoalaDAO #Blockathon community**.

- **3-6 months horizon:**

Inaugural Gardeners will facilitate the bootstrapping of the KoalaDAO.

At the initial phase, the Gardeners will hold majority reputatoin and will oversee the operation of the KoalaDAO #Blockathon to ensure momentum is set and the culture is healthy. Past 3 months, the intention is to evolve the reputation dynamically to reflect the contributors impact, merit and accountability.

- The Gardeners will be open for rotation and new members after the initial 3 months.

- **6-12 months horizon:**

The Gardeners will encourage the rotation of the inaugural crew members in case they have not naturally moved on. If it isn't done the community is welcome to call on the Gardeners to propose plans ü•≥

##### Bush Rangers (Advisors)
The rangers' role is to be there in case the Gardeners needs to review the structure of governance or operation processes and provide mentorship where needed. The rangers can be changed through a proposal to the KoalaDAO #Blockathon.

* These are guidelines for how to start with operation and governance and this will be reviewed over time to see if there are cases that haven't been thought through and can be improved.
