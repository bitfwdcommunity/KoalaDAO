### Governance in the #KoalaDAO

The #KoalaDAO will have initial stakeholders from the following 4 groups
1. Community - the early joeys
1. Communities Organizers -  #KoalaDAO friends who manage other communities.
1. Eucalyptus Tree Committee - The inaugal committee that will bootsrap the #KoalaDAO operationally.
1. Bush Rangers (Advisors) - Independent members who will provide the Eucalyptus Tree Committee feedback.

- **Reputation Dynamics** 

**Earning**
1. Earning reputation can be done in 2 ways (potentially other ways later)
 1. With a reputation request which outlines the reason the proposer believes they should receive rep.
 1. During the fortnightly retrospect the Eucalyptus Tree facilitator will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation allocation to members based on their work's impact and the merit they showed.

**Slashing**
1. Slashing of reputation can happen in 2 ways (potentially other ways later) 
 1. If a #KoalaDAO rep holder exhibit distructive actions which other members wish to propose a slashing for they are free and encouraged to do so - self regulation.
 1. During the fortnightly retrospect the Eucalyptus Tree facilitator will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation slashing to members based on their work's impact, merit and accountability.
 
#### Eucalyptus Tree Committee

The Eucalyptus Tree committee will act as the crew to oversee the guidance around minimaly required administration processes, culture, and project prioritization. **The eucalyptus tree committee will share a regular monthly resolution with the 
#KoalaDAO community**.

- **3-6 months horizon:**

Inaugaural Eucalyptus Tree Committee will facilitate the bootstrapping of the #KoalaDAO.

At the initial phase, the Eucalyptus Tree Committee will hold majority reputatoin and will oversee the operation of the #KoalaDAO to ensure momentum is set and the culture is healthy. Past 3 months, the intention is to evolve the reputation dynamically to reflect the contributors impact, merit and accountability. 

- The committee will be open for rotation and new members after the initial 3 months.

- **6-12 months horizon:**

The Eucalyptus Tree Committee will encourage the rotation of the inaugural committee members in case they have not naturally moved on.

##### Bush Rangers (Advisors)
The rangers' role is to be there in case the Eucalyptus tree committee needs to review the structure of governance or operation processes and provide mentorship where needed. The rangers can be changed through a proposal to the #KoalaDAO

* These are guidelines for how to start with operation and governance and this will be reviewed over time to see if there are cases that haven't been thought through and can be improved.
