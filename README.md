# #KoalaDAO V 1.0 - Joey
 This is readme file outlines how the [bitfwd community](twitter.com/bitfwdxyz) will roll out the #KoalaDAO experiment as a testbed for innovation and entrepreneurship in web3 native environment. 

## Brief
The #KoalaDAO mission is to manage projects and resources as a decentralized ecosystem accelerator community. At the initial stage, the majority of the reputation will be held with the [eucalyptus tree committee](https://github.com/bitfwdcommunity/KoalaDAO/blob/master/Initial_Rep.MD#60-initial-board--eucalyptus-tree-committee) as described in the governance section below. The reputation will be dynamically adjusted using DAOstack's Alchemy platform. Stakeholders of #KoalaDAO are diverse and come from different organizations or are independent contributors and others. 

### Web3 ecosystem acceleration
The mission #KoalaDAO embody is to bootsrap a peer-to-peer cryptoeconomy, serve the broad web3 ecosystem and specifically nourish the DAOstack ecosystem as a foundation.

### Culture focus
The culture of #KoalaDAO:
- **Celebrating entrepreneurship**

Encourage impactful action bias approach, minimize bureaucracy and self correct ruthlessly as issues arrise. 
 
 - **Grassroots driven** 

Core value to our ethos are initiatives that promote the success of the true p2p economy movement.
  
  - **Onboarding and education** 
  
A big focus for KoalaDAO is true diversity and inclusion through the onboarding and education using mediums like #Blockathon events, content, and other initiatives in the web3 ecosystem.

### Operation
- Sprints: Facilitated by the community wizard
* Every fortnight will be kicked off with a KoalaDAO catchup call with updates from teams re:
1. **Sprint targets** Each project team will share Sprint targets on the [Open KoalaDAO Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/bitfwdcommunity/projects/1#column-5827086)
1. **No-Fail-Goals** - Each project team will share NFG on the [Open KoalaDAO Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/bitfwdcommunity/projects/1#column-5827082)

- Retrospects: Facilitated by [bitfwd insight team üê®‚è©üåà](twitter.com/bitfwdxyz)
At the end of a fortnight we'll be looking at the performance of the sprint targets and the No Fail Goals, reporting will be done on the KoalaDAO open Kanban in the respective columns. 

- Agile Project plan: Facilitated by [Bob Jiang üê≤‚è©üåà](twitter.com/bobjiang123)

### Areas of activity
the #KoalaDAO will initially start by working on the following channels:


## China
The **KoalaDAO** will serve DAOstack by opening the channel to the Chinese market
- Meetups with leading crypto communities in major innovation hubs: Shenzhen, Beijing, Hangzou, Chengdu, Shanghai
- Content localization
- #Blockathon DAO China 
- Alchemy interface in Chinese
- Establish a Chinese community DAO similar to Genesis / KoalaDAO the **PanDAO** üêº‚è©üåà

## UX and Mobile
UX is a big area of interest with the bitfwd ecosystem. Particularly given our strong affiliation with Asia where mobile native is the norm. The areas which are of interest to us:

- Onboarding flow
- Wallet integration
- Bounty / Proposal representation
- Smart token interfaces (offer GEN staking functions straight in a mobile wallet)
- DAO Browser

## Digital/DAO Culture Configuration 
Research and development of DAO sustainability through culture configuration. The way we intend to do it is through the implementation of social campaigns and learn from experiments what trends are exhausting certain aspect of the DAOs (resoure, user engagement, growth etc) and what are nurturing using different governance and social configurations.

## Social Impact and Education
We work with students societies, universities, and social impact organizations on educational activities across developments and general literacy. Educating through the use of DAO ecosystem products is something we are very interested in. 

## Governance structure

Our MVG (Minimum Viable Governance) is found [here](https://github.com/bitfwdcommunity/KoalaDAO/blob/master/Governance.MD) and will potentially be reviewed.

## Deliverables and Timeline for phase 1 

## Follow up plans after Phase 1
PanDAO, mobile working groups, PanDAO #Blockathon, KoalaDAO evaluation
