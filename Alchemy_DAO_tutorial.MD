## Using the Alchemy DAO's interface.
#### If you're a first-time user of Alchemy DAO, take this handy guide with you!

### Materials
1. One of the following web browsers:
  1. Chrome
  1. Firefox
  1. Brave
1. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): a browser wallet that you can use to log into Alchemy DAO (and many other dapps!) with one click!
1. **Some ETH**: you'll need it to pay gas fees (pretty much transaction costs) when you submit and vote for (or against) any proposals on the DAO.
1. **(Optional but it helps a lot!) An active social media account** (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord, Telegram are all fantastic options!)

### Entering the DAO
In order to participate and vote for any proposals in a DAO, you need to ask for reputation first.
This is done by making your own proposal which requests for reputation.

So in the **Contribution Reward** section, you want to click on **+ New proposal**.

The above proposal form will appear. You should fill it in following the guidelines below:

N.B. These screenshots were pulled from the Genesis Alpha DAO: **#KoalaDAO will be using the same interface.**
N.B. The exact number you need to enter in **Reputation reward** is yet to be set. (Asking for 100 is the current convention at the moment in Genesis Alpha).

Click on **Submit proposal** and congratulations! You have made your first DAO proposal!

Now, waiting for your proposal to be voted on takes some time but to make sure that it passes, follow the [Application Guidelines](Application_Guideline.MD).
