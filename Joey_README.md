# KoalaDAO V 1.0 - Joey
 This is readme file outlines how the bitfwd community will roll out the KoalaDAO experiment as a testbed for innovation and entrepreneurship in web3 native environment. 

## Brief
The KoalaDAO mission is to manage projects and resources as a decentralized ecosystem accelerator community. At the initial stage, the majority of the reputation will be held with the eucalyptus tree committee as described in the governance section. The reputation will be dynamically adjusted using DAOstack's Alchemy platform. The stakeholders of KoalaDAO are diverse and come from different organizations or are independent contributors and others. 

### Web3 ecosystem acceleration
The mission KoalaDAO embody is to bootsrap a peer-to-peer cryptoeconomy, serve the broad web3 ecosystem and specifically nourish the DAOstack ecosystem as a foundation.

### Culture focus
The culture of KoalaDAO:
- **Celebrating entrepreneurship**
 Encourage impactful action bias approach, minimize bureaucracy and self correct as issues arrise. 
 
 - **Grassroots driven** 
  Core value to our ethos are initiatives that promote the success of the true p2p economy movement. 
  
  - **Onboarding and education** 
  A big focus for KoalaDAO is true diversity and inclusion through the onboarding and education using mediums like #Blockathon events, content, and other initiatives in the web3 ecosystem.

### Operation
- Sprints: Facilitated by Melissa Ran
* Every fortnight will be kicked off with a KoalaDAO catchup call with updates from teams re:
1. **Sprint targets** Each project team will share Sprint targets on the [Open KoalaDAO Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/bitfwdcommunity/projects/1#column-5827086)
1. **2 No-Fail-Goals** - Each project team will share NFG on the [Open KoalaDAO Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/bitfwdcommunity/projects/1#column-5827082)

- Retrospects: Facilitated by Melissa Ran üë∏üèª‚è©üåà
At the end of a fortnight we'll be looking at the performance of the sprint targets and the No Fail Goals, reporting will be done on the KoalaDAO open Kanban in the respective columns. 

- Agile Project plan: Facilitated by Bob Jiang üê≤‚è©üåà
Every project will get support of agile and scrum checkins and process design with Bob Jiang's help.

- Office Hours: Facilitated by Daniel Bar ü•≥‚è©üåà
Teams will be able to get checkins with mentors from the bitfwd network


### Governance 
At the initial phase, the Eucalyptus tree committee will hold majority reputatoin and will oversee the operation of the KoalaDAO until there's momentum and the culture is healthy enough. Past that point hopefully the reputation will evolve dynamically to reflect the contributors impact, merit and accountability. 

The KoalaDAO will have initial stakeholders from the following 4 groups
1. Community 
1. Communities Organizers
1. Eucalyptus Tree Committee
1. Advisors (Forest Rangers)

- Earning and slashing
1. Earning reputation can be done in 2 ways (potentially other ways later)
 1. With a reputation request which outlines the reason the proposer believes they should receive it
 1. During the fortnightly retrospect the Eucalyptus tree facilitator will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation allocation to members based on their work's impact and the merit they showed

1. Slashing of reputation can happen in 2 ways (potentially other ways later) 
 1. If a KoalaDAO rep holder exhibit actions which other members wish to propose a slashing or their rep they are free and encouraged to do so
 1. During the fortnightly retrospect the Eucalyptus tree facilitator will review the performance of the contributors and will be able to suggest reputation slashing to members based on their work's impact, merit and accountability.
 
 

Eucalyptus tree committee

The eucalyptus tree committee will act as the crew to oversee the guidance around administration processes, culture, and project prioritization. The eucalyptus tree committee will have regular monthly call that will have resolution shared with the KoalaDAO community.
