### Areas of activity
the #KoalaDAO will initially start by working on the following channels:


## China
The **KoalaDAO** will serve DAOstack by opening the channel to the Chinese market
- Meetups with leading crypto communities in major innovation hubs: Shenzhen, Beijing, Hangzou, Chengdu, Shanghai
- Content localization
- #Blockathon DAO China
- Alchemy interface in Chinese
- Establish a Chinese community DAO similar to Genesis / KoalaDAO the **PanDAO** üêº‚è©üåà

## UX and Mobile
UX is a big area of interest with the bitfwd ecosystem. Particularly given our strong affiliation with Asia where mobile native is the norm. The areas which are of interest to us:

- Onboarding flow
- Wallet integration
- Bounty / Proposal representation
- Smart token interfaces (offer GEN staking functions straight in a mobile wallet)
- DAO Browser

## Digital/DAO Culture Configuration
Research and development of DAO sustainability through culture configuration. The way we intend to do it is through the implementation of social campaigns and learn from experiments what trends are exhausting certain aspect of the DAOs (resoure, user engagement, growth etc) and what are nurturing using different governance and social configurations.

## Social Impact and Education
We work with students societies, universities, and social impact organizations on educational activities across developments and general literacy. Educating through the use of DAO ecosystem products is something we are very interested in.

## Governance structure

Our MVG (Minimum Viable Governance) is found [here](https://github.com/bitfwdcommunity/KoalaDAO/blob/master/Governance.MD) and will potentially be reviewed.

## Deliverables and Timeline for phase 1

## Follow up plans after Phase 1
PanDAO, mobile working groups, PanDAO #Blockathon, KoalaDAO evaluation
